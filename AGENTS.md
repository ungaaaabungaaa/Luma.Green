# AGENTS.md — Luma.Green

**Cleaner Tomorrow in Motion.**

This file is the single source of truth for how code gets written in this repo.
Every agent (Claude Code, CodeRabbit, Copilot, a human on their first day) reads
this first. `CLAUDE.md` just points here.

**Continuing the current work?** Read [the agent handoff](docs/delivery/handoff.md)
first for branch/commit checkpoints, verification, setup gates and next tasks.

Detailed, task-specific playbooks live in `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`. This file
tells you what the project is and the rules that always apply; a skill tells you
how to do one job well.

---

## 1. What we are building

Luma.Green connects the whole recycling chain on one platform: **households**
who sell scrap, **kabadiwalas** (local scrap shops) who collect it,
**preprocessors** (yards) who sort it further, **recyclers** who turn it into raw
material and **manufacturers** who buy that material — plus **Saathis**, people
who take pickup and sorting jobs. One **admin** verifies everyone. The pilot runs
in Bengaluru in October 2026.

1. **Recover** — a household books a pickup; the kabadiwala weighs and records it.
2. **Trade** — material moves up the chain, re-sorted at every step, visible by
   location and material.
3. **Retire** (later) — recorded material mints carbon credits, which are
   verified, held, traded and finally retired.

The plan, the decisions behind it and the runbooks live in `docs/` — start at
[docs/README.md](docs/README.md) before designing a feature.

Three properties follow from that and are non-negotiable:

- **The ledger must be auditable.** A regulator may ask how any credit was
  produced. Every state change writes to `auditLog`.
- **Numbers must be exact.** Money is integer **paise**, mass is integer
  **grams**, CO₂e is **kg**. No floats for money or mass, ever.
- **Issued credits are frozen.** A credit stores the emission factor used at
  issuance (`factorUsed`). Revising a factor later never restates a credit that
  is already issued.

  components/brand/  logo and brand assets
  components/providers/  the one provider stack
  i18n/              locale registry, routing, request config
  lib/               env, fonts, site constants, utils
  proxy.ts           locale negotiation (Next 16's middleware convention)
convex/              schema and server functions
apps/mobile/         Expo iOS/Android shell; generated native projects ignored

```

## 4. Rules that always apply

**Never hardcode user-facing copy.** Every string goes in `messages/en.json`
and is read with `useTranslations` / `getTranslations`. A PR that adds English
text to a component is wrong even if it looks fine — see
`.claude/skills/i18n`.

**Never import `next/link` or navigation helpers from `next/navigation`.** Use
`@/i18n/navigation`. ESLint enforces this; the failure it prevents is silent
(links drop the locale) and only shows up for non-English users.

**The one exception is the admin console** (`src/app/admin`,
`src/components/admin`): English only, outside the locale segment, so its copy
lives in the components and it uses Next's own `Link` and router. ESLint
allows this there and nowhere else.

**Never invent colours.** Use semantic tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`)
or the `brand-*` scale. A raw hex in a component is a bug — see
`.claude/skills/design-system`.

**Read the [current UI contract](docs/design/designer-system.md#current-ui-contract)
before any UI change**, then use `.claude/skills/design-system`. That contract is
the detailed owner of the founder's accepted design rules. Preserve the current
neutral themes, Geist/Noto typography and corner tokens. Use open sections,
dividers and useful content, not generic cards or filler tiles. Keep mobile
navigation, single-line action labels and all registered languages usable.

Use shared Lucide icons and control sizes. Recharts is available through the
vendored shadcn chart primitive; charts need recorded data and readable text/table
equivalents. Installed design skills are guidance, not permission to change the
brand, add cards, invent live statistics or present illustrations as app evidence.
The approved demo testimonials must remain visibly illustrative. Unavailable
live prices show loading/unavailable placeholders, never synthetic live quotes.

**UI completion requires visual inspection.** Inspect current browser captures
in light and dark mode, at phone/tablet/desktop widths and in affected translated
scripts, including RTL. Check real font loading, label fit and control overlap;
DOM assertions alone do not prove the page looks right. Use the matrix in the
current UI contract and retain the guide evidence required below.

Native shell controls use React Native primitives or OS menus and the shared
message catalogues. Their config modules validate public app settings; backend
secrets remain in Convex. See [native apps](docs/architecture/native-apps.md).

**Never add a web component by hand that shadcn already ships.** Run
`pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <name>`.

**Never commit a secret.** All config goes through `src/lib/env.ts`. Every var
is optional: a fresh clone with an empty `.env` must build, test and run.

**Never widen a type to make an error go away.** Fix the shape.

**Always add tests with the change.** Logic gets a unit test; a user-visible
flow gets an e2e test. See `.claude/skills/testing`.

**Always keep CI green.** `pnpm check` before you push. See
`.claude/skills/ci-checks`.

**The platform user guide is mandatory.** The editable source is
`docs/user-guide/guide.md`; the maintained editable Word artifact is
`output/docx/luma-green-user-guide.docx`. Read `docs/user-guide/README.md` before
changing a user-facing route, screen, role, permission, workflow, account setup
or native update behavior. Update the affected guide sections and recapture
changed screens from the browser. Rebuild the Word document, render and inspect every page,
and commit the source, screenshot evidence, build record and DOCX together.
Google Docs copies are imported from the reviewed DOCX and must be updated with
the same source. Read `docs/user-guide/cloud.json` for publication state. After
the first verified import, reuse that document ID and preserve its sharing
settings; record verified updates or an explicit pending connection gate.
Earlier PDFs are archived snapshots, not maintained outputs.
Record the guide impact in the delivery handoff even when no guide change is
needed. This is a required completion step, not optional follow-up work.

Screenshots must show the actual current UI with approved test data. Keep
synthetic component fixtures and older seeded captures explicitly labelled;
never claim they prove authenticated access or provider execution. Do not
capture passwords, authenticator QR/keys, backup codes, live IDs or customer
contact details. Never replace browser screenshots with generated interface
images. `src/user-guide.test.ts` checks that the committed DOCX matches its
source and screenshot inputs; fix stale documentation instead of bypassing it.

## 5. Commands

```bash
pnpm dev            # dev server
pnpm check          # lint + types + web/native unit tests before every push
pnpm apps:check     # mobile + desktop policy tests and types
pnpm mobile:export # iOS/Android JavaScript bundles (not installers)
pnpm desktop:pack  # unsigned host desktop app
pnpm test           # unit tests
pnpm test:watch     # unit tests, watch mode
pnpm e2e            # Playwright (needs `pnpm build` first when CI=1)
pnpm build          # production build
pnpm format         # prettier --write
pnpm convex:dev     # Convex dev deployment + codegen
```

## 6. Conventions

**Commits** follow Conventional Commits, enforced by commitlint:
`feat(inventory): reserve stock when a trade is accepted`.
Scopes: `app ui i18n convex auth inventory trade carbon seo ci deps docs test mobile infra`.

**Branches**: `feat/short-slug`, `fix/short-slug`, `chore/short-slug`.

**`main` is protected.** Every change — including an agent's — lands through a
PR with the five required checks green. Never try to push to `main` directly; it
will be rejected. The author merges their own PR (solo team, zero approvals), and
merged branches delete themselves.

**Server vs client**: components are server components unless they need state,
effects or browser APIs. Push `"use client"` as far down the tree as possible —
a client boundary adds its imports to the browser bundle. Passing rendered
server children through a provider preserves their server boundary. Keep static
public HTML and measured route caching where appropriate; do not force
request-time rendering just to call it SSR. Never add a shared cache for
sessions, authorisation, private records or changing live prices. See the
[rendering audit](docs/delivery/rendering-cache-audit.md).

**Data fetching**: Convex `useQuery` for live data. TanStack Query for anything
else async. Never `fetch` in a component body.

**Errors**: throw typed errors from Convex functions; surface them with
`toast.error(t("common.error"))`. Never swallow an error silently.

## 7. Working with money, mass and carbon

```ts
// Right
const totalPaise = (quantityGrams * pricePerKgPaise) / 1000; // integer math
// Wrong
const total = kg * pricePerKg; // float — drifts, and an audit will find it
```

Format at the edge only, with `next-intl`'s `useFormatter`, so currency and
number formatting follow the user's locale.

## 8. Accessibility and RTL

Every feature must work in `/ar` and `/ur`. Use logical properties
(`ms-*`/`me-*`, `ps-*`/`pe-*`, `text-start`/`text-end`) — never `ml-*`/`text-left`.
Every interactive element needs an accessible name. Test keyboard navigation
before calling a flow done. `src/i18n/locales.ts` owns the supported locale list
(currently 33); do not maintain a second list in controls or tests. For decimal
entry, use the shared `src/lib/number-input.ts` helpers with the active locale,
then keep amounts in integer grams/paise. Follow `.claude/skills/i18n` for copy,
ICU arguments and script coverage.

## 9. Integration boundaries

Optional services must remain disabled without configuration. Local mock tests
do not prove account approval, provider execution or production deployment.
See `docs/operations/launch-checklist.md` before enabling a service.

Convex **is** wired: the schema is deployed and `convex/_generated` is committed,
so `api` and `Doc`/`Id` types are safe to import today.

Better Auth **is** wired too: phone codes at `/login`, the admin at
`/admin/login` (set up once at `/admin/setup`). Guard every Convex function
with `requireUser` / `requireAdmin` from `convex/lib/access.ts`, and run
`pnpm auth:schema` after changing a Better Auth plugin. Read
`docs/architecture/auth.md` before touching auth. Account security and inbox
routes must work for households and applicants as well as approved operators.
Keep phone-only users passwordless; admin email recovery must remain confined
to the configured existing admin identity. Never bypass a factor with a preview
screen or restore a session before the full challenge succeeds. Test the real
Better Auth HTTP handler and Convex adapter for changes to this boundary.

Onboarding **is** wired: `/join` (public) → `/join/{kind}` → `/join/status`.
Every field rule lives once in `convex/lib/onboarding.ts` — the forms validate
with those schemas and `applications.submit` runs them again; change a rule
there, never in a component.

- **MSG91** — OTP sending and per-number limits are implemented. Status
  notifications use a separate outbox and approved Flow templates.
- **OpenRouter or self-hosted vision** — optional transient photo estimates; server quotas and table
  prices. See `docs/architecture/ai-estimation.md`.
- **PostHog, Google Analytics 4 and Sentry** — implemented, optional, off by
  default. `NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true` and each provider's settings are
  required. Analytics also requires the visitor's choice and measures only the
  explicit marketing-route allowlist; never add private forms, booking tokens,
  identities or record contents to events. Sentry error reporting is separate
  from that choice and uses an allowlist that removes identifying context.
  Read [observability](docs/operations/observability.md) before changing capture.
- **Search ownership** — optional Google Search Console and Bing metadata
  tokens. Follow [search setup](docs/operations/seo.md); tags do not prove live
  verification or indexing.
- **Account inbox and optional push** — reuse the booking/application event
  owner. Browser and Expo delivery are off until configured. Obtain explicit
  device permission; keep lock-screen copy generic, validate trusted native
  documents, revoke installation bindings before sign-out and test late results.
  Electron notices work while the process runs. See
  [push notifications](docs/operations/push-notifications.md) before changes.
- **Resend** — optional admin password recovery only. Keep its key on Convex;
  missing settings must show an honest unavailable state. A provider acceptance
  response is not proof of inbox delivery. Reset preserves required TOTP.
- **Razorpay, R2, Mapbox** — not required for the pilot. No payment
  processing is implemented. Documents use Convex storage; location uses the browser.
- **Expo / React Native and Electron** — native shells are in `apps/`. Signed
  builds, native device tests, store review and update delivery remain release
  gates. Follow [app releases](docs/operations/app-releases.md).

## 10. Lint

The config is strict on purpose (`eslint.config.mjs`). Type-aware rules run
against a real TS program, so lint is slower than you may be used to and catches
things a typecheck alone will not.

What it enforces, beyond the obvious:

- **No floating or misused promises.** A dropped `await` in a settlement or
  credit mutation loses money silently. This is the most valuable rule here.
- **No `any`, no `!`.** Fix the shape instead.
- **No `toLocaleString`/`toLocaleDateString`.** Use next-intl's formatter so
  output follows the user's locale.
- **No TS `enum`.** Union of string literals, or a `const` object.
- **Exhaustive switches** over status unions — adding a trade status breaks every
  switch that forgot it.
- **No `next/link`** — locale-aware navigation from `@/i18n/navigation` only.
- **Import order** is auto-fixed; never hand-sort.
- `sonarjs` and `unicorn` on top for bug patterns and dead code.

Lint and typecheck run `next typegen` first: route and root-param types are
generated into `.next/types`, and without them type-aware rules see `any` and
fail — on a fresh clone and in CI, but never on a machine with a stale `.next/`.

`pnpm lint:fix` handles most of it. Relaxations are scoped and commented —
vendored `src/components/ui/**`, the Convex validator DSL, tests, e2e, and root
config files each get a narrow override. If you need a new one, scope it to a
path and write down why.

**Never add a blanket `eslint-disable` for a file.** A single-line disable with a
reason comment is fine when the rule is genuinely wrong — as in `src/proxy.ts`,
where `String.raw` would break Next's static analysis of the matcher.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
