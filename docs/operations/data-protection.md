# Data protection

> **Status:** draft, 29 Sep 2026. **Not legal advice.** Facts gathered on that
> date from UIDAI, MeitY, CERT-In and the DPDP Rules; have a lawyer review this
> page and the privacy notices before the pilot handles real data.

## Which rules apply, and when

| Rule                                                   | In force                                               | What it asks of us                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| IT Act s.43A and the 2011 SPDI Rules                   | Now                                                    | Reasonable security for personal data                                                                                                      |
| CERT-In Directions (April 2022)                        | Now                                                    | Report a cyber incident **within 6 hours** of noticing it; keep system logs for **180 days** (may be stored abroad if we can produce them) |
| Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 + Rules 2025 | Rules notified Nov 2025; main duties from ~13 May 2027 | Notice, consent, purpose limits, security, breach reporting, erasure, children's data                                                      |
| Aadhaar Act 2016 and its regulations                   | Now                                                    | We don't collect or store Aadhaar numbers at all                                                                                           |

We build to the DPDP standard now, so nothing has to change in 2027.

Nothing is collected "just in case". A new field needs a line in this table.

## Aadhaar

- We **never** collect, store or display a full Aadhaar number. An entity doing
  offline verification "shall not collect, use or store Aadhaar number"; storing
  one lawfully needs an Aadhaar Data Vault hosted in India. Penalties run to
  ₹1 crore per breach plus ₹10 lakh a day.
- A Saathi may upload a **masked** Aadhaar (last four digits visible) as one of
  several accepted IDs. Alternatives are always offered: voter ID, driving
  licence, PAN, or a DigiLocker document.
- If someone uploads an unmasked Aadhaar, the admin asks for a masked copy and
  the file is deleted — it's an item on the verification checklist.
- The admin's own profile keeps only the last four digits, and Aadhaar is never
  part of signing in.

## Notice and consent

- **A notice per role, before we collect anything:** what we collect, why, how
  to withdraw consent and how to complain. In the user's language — English,
  Kannada and Hindi first (the DPDP Act allows English or any Eighth-Schedule
  language).
- **Consent is specific.** Photo estimation requires an explicit action. No
  training collection or opt-in is implemented. Adding one needs its own notice
  and storage/retention design.
- **18 and over.** Everyone who registers confirms they are 18+; households
  confirm it when booking. The DPDP Act needs verifiable parental consent for
  anyone younger, and we don't serve minors.

## Rights: access, correction, erasure

- Anyone can ask by SMS or email to see, correct or delete their data. The
  admin handles it within **30 days** (our target).
- Erasure removes the data from production at once, except what a law makes us
  keep (tax records, 72 months). Copies in backups expire within 12 months
  ([backups.md](./backups.md#personal-data-in-backups)).

## Safeguards

- Every Convex function checks who's asking before it reads or writes.
- Private files are served only through permission-checked HTTP actions
  ([auth.md](../architecture/auth.md#private-files)).
- The admin signs in with a password and an authenticator code.
- HTTPS everywhere; providers encrypt at rest; backups on an encrypted disk and
  encrypted again when copied off-site.
- Keys have the least permission that works and a spend limit where offered.
- Admin actions are written to the audit log.
- **Gap:** Convex and Vercel free plans keep function logs only briefly. Our own
  audit log and events tables meet the one-year processing-log rule, but
  CERT-In's 180-day system-log rule needs Convex log streams (Pro) or a regular
  log export before we grow past the pilot.

## Where the data lives

| Processor                                      | What it handles                | Where               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Convex                                         | All records and files          | EU West (Ireland)   |
| Vercel                                         | Web pages and server rendering | Global edge network |
| MSG91                                          | Phone numbers and message text | India               |
| OpenRouter and the model provider it routes to | Household photos for estimates | Outside India       |

The DPDP Act allows transfers abroad unless the government restricts a
country; no restriction on the EU was found as of 29 Sep 2026 — confirm before
launch. The privacy notice names every processor.

## If personal data leaks

1. **Contain it:** revoke access, rotate keys ([incidents.md](./incidents.md)).
2. **CERT-In within 6 hours** of noticing a cyber incident
   (`incident@cert-in.org.in`, with the format in the CERT-In directions).
3. **The Data Protection Board** (once DPDP duties apply): tell it without
   delay, with a detailed report within **72 hours**.
4. **The people affected:** tell them without delay, in their language — what
   happened, what data, what they should do.
5. Write it up in the incidents log.

## Before the pilot

- [ ] Privacy notice per role in English, Kannada and Hindi, reviewed by a lawyer
- [ ] 18+ confirmation in onboarding and at booking
- [ ] "Unmasked Aadhaar → reject and delete" on the Saathi checklist
- [ ] Verify transient photo behavior and provider retention terms; no photo storage is implemented
- [ ] Define outbox retention and scheduled cleanup for rejected applications
- [ ] A way to handle "my data" requests
- [ ] The processor list and each provider's data processing terms checked
- [ ] Tax advice on whether Luma.Green is an e-commerce operator under GST
      ([open questions](../product/open-questions.md))
