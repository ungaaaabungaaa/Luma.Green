# Onboarding and verification

> **Status:** built, 29 Sep 2026 — the forms, uploads and status screen. The
> admin's verification queue comes next. Clickable screens:
> [Luma.Green Prototype](https://claude.ai/artifact/4hiq2r5tm5kWDBqTGEPD8C)
> (private until shared). URLs: [architecture/urls.md](../architecture/urls.md).
> Data: [architecture/data-model.md](../architecture/data-model.md).

Every business role and every Saathi goes through the same door, then fills in
the form for their role, then waits for a person to check it. Households never
register.

## The flow

```
Language ─► Phone ─► SMS code ─► What do you do? ─► Form for that role ─► Submitted
                                                                              │

1. **Language.** A grid of all 33 languages in their own script, shown until the
   user picks one. Kannada, Hindi and English appear first for Bengaluru.
2. **Phone.** A 10-digit Indian mobile number.
3. **SMS code.** Six digits sent through MSG91 on a DLT-registered template.
   Resend after 30 seconds. See [architecture/auth.md](../architecture/auth.md).
4. **What do you do?** Kabadiwala · Preprocessor (yard) · Recycler ·
   Manufacturer · Saathi. Households are pointed to the photo flow instead.
5. **The form for that role** — below.
6. **Submitted.** The status screen shows "Under review — usually 12–24 hours"
   and what we check.

A user can leave at any point and continue later: the form saves itself as a
draft a moment after every change. After signing in, everyone lands on
`/join/status`, which picks up where they are.

Every applicant confirms they are **18 or older** and reads the privacy notice
for their role before the first form ([data protection](../operations/data-protection.md#notice-and-consent)).

## What each role gives us

Taken from the founder's documents diagram. "Proposed" marks an addition that
the diagram does not have and still needs a yes.

### Household

Nothing at registration — there is none. At **booking** we take the phone
number (confirmed by SMS code) and the pickup location. See
[household.md](./household.md).

One screen, one "Send for verification" button.

### Preprocessor (yard), recycler and manufacturer

These three share one form in two steps; the title and a few hints change with
the role.

**Step 1 — business details**

The application and approved organisation now accept optional `siteType` and
`materialOrigins` declarations. The site values include a preprocessor yard,
recycling or manufacturing facility, apartment community, office, hotel,
resort and other site. Origins distinguish industrial byproducts from
post-consumer material. These fields preserve source facts through admin
approval; they are not yet collected by this form and do not grant trading
rights or certify the material. Existing applications and organisations remain
valid without them.

**Step 2 — documents and photos**

Payment details are **not** collected: Saathi pay is out of scope for now.

## Application states

| State               | Who moves it                | Next                                        | What the applicant sees                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `draft`             | Applicant, while filling in | `submitted`                                 | Their form, saved                                  |
| `submitted`         | Applicant                   | `approved`, `changes_requested`, `rejected` | "Under review — usually 12–24 hours"               |
| `changes_requested` | Admin, with a note          | `submitted` (on resubmit)                   | The admin's note and a "Fix and resubmit" button   |
| `approved`          | Admin                       | `suspended`                                 | "You're verified" and the way into their dashboard |
| `rejected`          | Admin, with a reason        | — (a new application after talking to us)   | The reason and how to contact us                   |
| `suspended`         | Admin                       | `approved`                                  | "Your account is paused" and how to contact us     |

Rules:

- Every transition writes an `auditLog` row: who, when, from, to, and the note.
- A resubmission keeps the earlier version; the admin sees what changed.
- Nothing in the business dashboards opens before `approved`. A user in any
  other state is sent to the status screen.
- The SLA clock starts at `submitted`. At 18 hours an application shows **Due
  soon**, at 24 hours **Overdue**.

## What the admin checks

| Role                                 | Checklist (every item ticked before _Approve_ unlocks)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

_Ask for changes_ and _Reject_ always need a written note; it is shown to the
applicant and kept in the audit log.

## Messages we send

Over SMS (MSG91, DLT-registered templates) in the user's language; WhatsApp
later. The templates to register are listed in
[operations/services.md](../operations/services.md#sms-templates-to-register).

| When              | To        | Says                                 |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Code requested    | Applicant | The 6-digit code                     |
| Submitted         | Applicant | We've got it; usually 12–24 hours    |
| Approved          | Applicant | You're verified; open the app        |
| Changes requested | Applicant | What to fix; link to the form        |
| Rejected          | Applicant | We couldn't verify; how to reach us  |
| New submission    | Admin     | (in-app queue for the pilot; no SMS) |

## Privacy

- **Why we collect each field** is shown next to the field where it isn't
  obvious (for example, _"we call this number to check your shop"_).
- **Aadhaar.** We never ask for, store or display a full Aadhaar number. A
  Saathi may upload a **masked** Aadhaar (last four digits visible) as their
  photo ID; the admin's own profile keeps only the last four digits.
- **Documents and photos** are private files. Only the applicant and the admin
  can open them; every request is checked
  ([auth.md](../architecture/auth.md#private-files)).
- **Retention.** Rejected applications and their files are deleted after 90
  days; approved ones are kept while the account is active. Details and the
  legal basis: [operations/data-protection.md](../operations/data-protection.md).

## Open

1. Should GST be required for yards, recyclers and manufacturers once escrow
   invoicing starts?
2. "Location tags" — area names (as built), landmarks, or several sites per
   business?
3. Do home-pickup Saathis need police verification before their first job?
4. "What all he wants" for each hand-off — see [roles.md](./roles.md).
