# Expo SDK 57 release compatibility review

7 October 2026. Hosted Expo compatibility required four new SDK 57 patch
versions. The local native tests, types, compatibility check and Android/iOS
export pass with the updated lockfile. A clean hosted install then rejected
18 required packages because their publication age was below 24 hours.

The release uses exact-version cooldown exceptions for that reviewed cohort.
The default cooldown, install-script allowlist, dependency overrides and
node-forge security patch are unchanged. No CI check is removed or skipped.
Remove these exceptions after **7 October 2026, 12:15 UTC**; all cohort packages
then meet the normal age rule. This does not authorize future versions.

For all 18 versions, the official npm registry SHA-512 integrity value matches
the committed lockfile. All 36 registry signatures verify against the current
official npm signing key. All declare publisher `alanhughes` and Expo source
commit `50ac74f1ab5682c8e32b24da6e5e97dd4dbbb80f`. The official repository
identifies that commit as a package publication. The cohort was published from
6 October 2026, 12:07:16 to 12:14:47 UTC.

This verifies registry integrity and declared source identity. It does not prove
reproducible builds or absence of malicious code. npm build-provenance
attestations are unavailable and the source commit is unsigned.
