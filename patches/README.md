## node-forge 1.4.0: nested DigestAlgorithm validation

The workspace applies `node-forge@1.4.0.patch` to every installed copy of
`node-forge` 1.4.0. This is a temporary backport of the `lib/rsa.js` change in
[upstream PR 1152](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/pull/1152), pinned to
commit `ceba34402e329f0365134f23fe19898756527d65`.

The [advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-86w9-cpqp-85rv) still has no
published fixed release as checked on 2 October 2026. The upstream PR is open.
This patch is reviewed and tested locally; it is not a released upstream fix.
The package retains version 1.4.0. `pnpm audit` therefore still reports the
high-severity advisory. No advisory is suppressed and no version is falsified.

The change checks the number of ASN.1 elements in the nested DigestAlgorithm
sequence after normal structure validation. It permits the algorithm OID and
its optional NULL parameter, and rejects unconsumed elements. RSA operations,
padding, supported algorithms and valid certificate formats are unchanged.

### Provenance

- Patch SHA-256: `4fa957cddb4b4601a48b535053d0fec7ed013f9d075660a38365f285fc830fe0`.
- Patched `lib/rsa.js` SHA-256: `acc22e5d36e27832c34e02dd3933aad7977d45b047eead5016520735efedc9c5`.
- The patched file is byte-identical to the upstream commit's `lib/rsa.js`.
- The public regression vector comes from that commit's `tests/unit/rsa.js`.
  Its BSD license is retained beside the fixture at
  `apps/mobile/test/fixtures/node-forge.LICENSE.txt`. No production key is used.

### Verification

`pnpm --filter @luma/mobile check` runs the committed regression tests. They
resolve node-forge through Expo CLI, CLI certificates and Expo Updates
certificates separately. All three rejected-signature assertions failed before
the patch and pass after it, using the public verifier defaults. Controls cover
valid SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 signatures; SHA-256 parameters with and
without NULL; Expo certificate and CSR generation; and update signing checked
with Node's independent verifier.

The full upstream Node suite was also run against the patched 1.4.0 library:
829 passed, four existing key-generation tests skipped by their upstream
runtime conditions. The temporary test checkout expanded an upstream
`describe.only('jsbn', ...)` to `describe('jsbn', ...)` so that the entire suite
ran. No production source or assertion was changed for that run. Browser tests
of node-forge itself and signed native delivery are not claimed.

### Use and removal

Use the pinned pnpm workspace install with its lockfile and patch file. The
patch is installed in CI and used by the local Expo export/development tools.
It does not alter deployed native OS cryptography or the web/backend runtime.

A globally installed tool or `pnpm dlx eas-cli` uses a separate dependency tree
and does not inherit this patch. Treat that tool as unverified: do not use it for
release signing until its affected verifier has an upstream fix or the same
reviewed patch and regression proof. A successful local bundle export does not
prove the safety of a separately installed release CLI.

When an official fixed node-forge release is published, update the dependency
resolution, remove this patch and its `patchedDependencies` entry together, and
retain the behavioral tests. Run the audit, mobile checks and both JavaScript
exports again. Do not remove the patch solely to clear an install or audit error.
